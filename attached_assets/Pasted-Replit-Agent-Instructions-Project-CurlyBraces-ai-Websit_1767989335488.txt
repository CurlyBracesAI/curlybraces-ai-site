Replit Agent Instructions

Project: CurlyBraces.ai Website Update
Objective: Reposition the site around Agent G as an onboarding & marketing AI for mental health & wellness practices, without competing with EHRs.

1. Core Positioning (DO NOT DEVIATE)

CurlyBraces is not:

an EHR

a clinical documentation system

a scheduling or billing platform

CurlyBraces is:

An AI platform delivering Agent G, focused on onboarding, triage, follow-up, and ethical practice growth for mental health & wellness providers.

2. Homepage – Hero Section (REPLACE EXISTING)

Headline (use one of these, pick the first unless layout forces change):

AI for onboarding and growth in mental health & wellness practices

Sub-headline:

Agent G manages inquiries, triage, follow-ups, and onboarding so practitioners can focus on care, not admin.

Supporting line (small text):

Works with EHR systems or HIPAA-compliant Google-based workflows. No notes. No billing. No disruption.

CTA:

Primary: “Request early access”

Secondary (optional): “See how Agent G works”

3. One-paragraph Definition (ADD BELOW HERO)

Agent G is an AI assistant built for mental health and wellness practices to handle the messy, time-consuming work that happens before a patient ever receives care. It manages inbound inquiries, evaluates fit, follows up thoughtfully, and prepares clean hand-offs to existing systems — without touching clinical notes, scheduling, or billing.

4. Replace “AI Agents” Section with Agent G Focus

Section title:

Meet Agent G

What Agent G does:

Handles website, email, directory, and referral inquiries

Performs pre-intake triage based on practice rules

Manages onboarding follow-ups and drop-off recovery

Supports ethical, capacity-aware outreach

Prepares structured hand-offs to EHRs or Google-based workflows

Explicitly state what it does NOT do (must be visible):

No clinical notes

No diagnosis or treatment records

No scheduling or billing

Never replaces professional judgment

5. “Who It’s For” Section (REPLACE GENERIC USE CASES)

Title:

Built for mental health & wellness practices

Include short bullets:

Therapists & psychologists

Group practices & clinics

Acupuncturists

Physical therapists

Massage & bodywork practices

Nutrition & integrative care providers

Add one anchoring sentence:

Designed for practices where trust, fit, and thoughtful onboarding matter.

6. Integrations Section (REORDER + REFRAME)

Change headline to:

Works with your existing systems

Two sub-groups:

EHRs:

TherapyNotes

SimplePractice

(label others as “and similar platforms”)

Lightweight workflows:

HIPAA-compliant Google Workspace (Docs, Calendar, Gmail)

Supporting line:

No migration. No retraining. Agent G fits into how you already work.

7. Remove or De-emphasize

Proposal Generator

Sales / deal / pipeline language

Generic “AI marketplace” framing

If these remain in code, hide them from navigation and homepage.

8. Compliance & Safety Section (KEEP CALM, NOT LEGAL)

Ensure this is visible but not alarmist:

HIPAA-eligible infrastructure

Encrypted data

Access controls

Human-in-the-loop by default

Agent G never provides clinical advice

9. Tone & Style Rules

Calm, confident, healthcare-adjacent

No hype, no “disrupt healthcare” language

Avoid startup buzzwords

Trust > cleverness

10. Non-goals (IMPORTANT)

DO NOT:

Add new features

Invent clinical capabilities

Expand into scheduling, notes, or billing

Rebrand CurlyBraces entirely

This is a positioning + copy update, not a rebuild.

✅ Definition of Done

Homepage clearly centers on Agent G

Mental health & wellness audience is obvious within 5 seconds

EHR competition risk is explicitly avoided

Site feels narrower, calmer, and more intentional

That’s it.
If the Replit Agent still goes rogue after this, we demote it to intern.
