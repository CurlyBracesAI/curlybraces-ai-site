Replit Agent Instructions: CurlyBraces.ai Website Update (SaaS Shift)
1. Reposition CurlyBraces.ai as a SaaS product, not a consultancy

Replace all consultancy-toned language with SaaS-oriented copy.
Emphasize:

subscription plans

plug-and-play setup

ready-made AI agents

integrations with platforms (Pipedrive, Wix, etc.)

self-service onboarding

Remove or rewrite anything that implies bespoke “custom builds.”

2. Update hero section

Replace the current “Agentic AI Automation that adapts to your business” copy with:

Headline:
“AI Agents That Automate Your Proposals, Follow-Ups, and Reports”

Sub:
“Ready-to-use automation for your CRM and web platforms. Fast setup. No engineering required.”

Add a CTA button: “Start Free Trial” (or “Install on Pipedrive” when live).

3. Replace customization-focused feature cards with SaaS-style benefits

Create 4 new cards:

Plug-and-Play Setup
Works instantly with Pipedrive, Wix, HubSpot (coming soon).

Purpose-Built AI Agents
Proposal writer, follow-up generator, triage assistant, data enricher.

Scales With Your Team
From solo users to full sales teams. Per-user and usage plans available.

Enterprise-Grade Quality

4. Add a pricing section

Core — $29/mo

All Basic features

Multi-step automations

Optional Add-Ons

usage-based billing for heavy customers

5. Add a “Supported Platforms” strip

Place near top or mid-page.

Logos:
Pipedrive • Wix • HubSpot • Webflow • WordPress • Shopify
(Use “coming soon” tags where needed.)

6. Convert vertical/industry sections into use-case examples

Rewrite real estate, legal, architecture, healthcare etc. sections as examples of how the existing agents are used, not pitches for custom projects.

Focus on:

speed

accuracy

time saved

automation value
Not “we build bespoke workflows.”

7. Update footer + contact flow

Change “Schedule a Consultation” to:

“Create Account”

“Start Free Trial”

“Request Enterprise Plan” (optional)

Keep an email for support, but the primary UX should reinforce SaaS, not agency.

8. Remove the beta-program framing

Replace any “Beta Partner”, “Let’s talk”, or “Custom Integration Discussion” language with SaaS terminology:

onboarding

setup

install

trial

usage

subscription
No more “let’s meet and discuss your needs.”

9. Keep design/layout intact

Do not alter structure unless necessary.
Focus on copy replacement, not redesign.
